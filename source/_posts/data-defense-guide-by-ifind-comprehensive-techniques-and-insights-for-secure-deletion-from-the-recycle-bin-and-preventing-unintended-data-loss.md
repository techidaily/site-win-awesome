## Recycle Bin Recovery – All you need to know

* ![recycling bin recovery](https://www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/recycling-bin.jpg)

Recycle Bin is the place your deleted files go in windows 10/7/8, and I know that you can restore deleted files there with just a few clicks. However, for Recycle Bin Recovery, there are some more complicated situations you should know about.

## Recycle Bin Corrupted

![Recycle Bin Corrupted](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Recycle-Bin-Corrupted.jpg?resize=525%2C125&ssl=1)

**Step 1:** click start and input “cmd,” then right-click on the Command Prompt, click Run as Administrator(To make sure you have the Permission)

## Notice:

Windows has separate Recycle Bin for each partition. If you get a warning message says The recycle bin on F: is corrupted, you should use F to replace C in the command.

![Command Prompt as administrator](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Command-Prompt-2.jpg?resize=393%2C588&ssl=1)

**Step 2:** Input the following command and click Enter.  
`rd /s /q C:\$Recycle.bin`

![cmd](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cmd.jpg?resize=677%2C176&ssl=1)

**Step 3:** Restart your computer, and you will find a fresh new Recycle Bin there.

After the fix, you need to doublecheck the previously deleted files in your Recycle Bin. If it’s empty, you may have a more chance to get the deleted files back with our software following our tip [How to Restore Deleted Files](https://www.ifind-recovery.com/how-to/restore-deleted-files-software/).

## Recycle Bin Missing in Windows 10/8/7

Sometimes you can’t find the Recycle Bin or the files you deleted for no reason! Here are the tips for getting them back!

### 1\. How to Recover or Restore Missing Recycle Bin Icon in Windows 10/7/8

**Step 1**: Click Start and select the **Settings** button.

**Step 2**: Select one after another “Personalization” – “Themes” – “Desktop icon Settings.”

![desktop icon settings](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/desktop-icon-settings.jpg?resize=1024%2C364&ssl=1)

**Step 3**: Check the Recycle Bin option, and then select OK.

![Recycle Bin icon option](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Recycle-Bin-icon.jpg?resize=397%2C452&ssl=1)

Notice: If you didn’t get the icon back after step 3, there is another way to create it manual

**Step 1**: open File Explorer, click the View tab and then click Options on the right side.

![File Explorer option](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/File-Explorer-option.jpg?resize=981%2C176&ssl=1)

**Step 2**: Then select the “View” tab, click the options button of “Show hidden files, folders and drives” under the option “hidden files and folders.” (you can change it back when you had fixed all the problem) and click OK.

![Show hidden files](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Show-hidden-files.jpg?resize=383%2C473&ssl=1)

**Step 3**: Go to C: in File Explorer and you will find a folder named “$Recycle.Bin” which is exactly the recycle bin location for windows 10 and win7, right-click on it, move to “sent to” and select “Desktop (create shortcut).” You should get the icon back!

### _Deleted files still not in Recycle Bin?_

You should doublecheck the **Move Files to Recycle Bin Option** at this time.

**Step 1**: right-click the Recycle Bin on your desktop and click Properties.

**Step 2**: Then select the option button “Custom Size” instead of “Don’t Move Files to Recycle Bin setting on the window below.”

### 1\. Forget about Shortcut Shift+Del when you are deleting anything.

There are many folks(including me) love to del files with the Shift key. Yes, it’s easy and fast, but you may take the risk of losing your important data without any safety precautions!

### 2\. Don’t Delete Files on Flash Drives

You should know that any of USB device is not included in your recycle bin. The best solution is to copy all the data in your flash drive to your hard drive before you need to edit or delete. Plus, if you are using SDD, the speed will much faster!

### 3\. Don’t use CMD to delete your files

I know lots of geeks and Coders like to type command in CMD or Powershell. However, when you do the deleting this style, the recycling bin will always ignore it, and you will lose the data forever.

### 4\. set up a larger Custom Size for Recycle Bin

Like we mentioned above, there is a custom size option in Recycle bin Properties. This size is used to decide whether a deleted file can be in Recycle Bin or delete directly. With the faster internet speed and larger HDD, we are dealing with more huge files than ever, such as music and video files, large software, system ios which are usually more than 1GB. When you set a Small number for custom size, you have a massive risk of losing these kinds of data by accidentally deleted without passing through the recycle bin.

Data is priceless! Following our tips and guide, we hope all your data are safe, always safe. In case you have some files lost or deleted by accident, try our free data recovery software to get it back!
