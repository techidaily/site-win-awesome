## Step-by-Step Guide to Converting Your Favorite Viu Episodes Into Downloads

### Overview

My Mum likes to watch Korean dramas on Viu and I plan to download some Korean dramas on Viu for her to watch when she is at hometown where the internet connection is not good. I do not have subscribed Viu. Can you tell me how I can download the Viu Korean videos without Viu subscription member?

Viu is a popular Hong Kong-based OTT video website on which users can enjoy excellent Asia video contents, like Korean videos, Japanese videos, Chinese videos, Thai videos, etc. Users can watch Viu videos for free, but downloading Viu videos is not accessed by any one. Only Viu premium subscribers with Viu app can download unlimited Viu contents for offline playback and Viu premium subscribed are not allowed to store the downloaded Viu videos on SD card due to the content licensing rights. So here comes a question, that is, how do Viu free users download Viu videos for flexible offline playback on any personal device? To get this completed, users only need a professional Viu downloader - Allavsoft.
