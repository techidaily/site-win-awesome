### Overview

Want to download CNBC U.S. video, Asia video, Europe video, CEO interviews, etc to your mobile phones or other local devices for offline watching at leisure time?

CNBC provides video reprint license service. If you have paid for a video reprint license, you can post CNBC video to your blog, corporate website, intranet site or other networks, like YouTube, Facebook, etc by embedding the CNBC video link and if the visitor clicks the video link the visitor will still stay on your web page and is not redirected to CNBC. The only drawback with this service for users is that the file format of this service is limited to Windows Media files and the video is not allowed to edit. If you want another video format, like DVD, you need to pay for another reprint license.
