## Step-by-Step Guide: Downloading Recorded Zoom Sessions via Shared Link

### Overview

* Recently, I got a Zoom meeting link from my teacher and he asked me to download the Zoom recording for watching offline, but I tried many times but still do not know how to get this Zoom recording meeting downloaded. Any recommended method?

Users may find many useful meetings and recording on Zoom and want to download some of them for offline study at leisure time. Users may find it easier to download or record their own recordings which are saved to users documents folder or they can easily record the meetings as Zoom hosts. However, users may not download the Zoom meetings shared by others via a link. Any idea? Well, Zoom does not allow users to download the meetings if they are not a host and users need a third party Zoom Video downloader named Allavsoft to get this kind of Zoom meeting downloaded.
