I like EmEditor, it’s a really good text editor, especially in processing Unicode & Multibye characters, but I think the default color themes it provides still can be enhanced.  
 I like low-contrast and dark background color themes such as the [Minimal theme in textmate](http://minimaldesign.net/downloads/tools/textmate-theme) and the [Zenburn theme in vim](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/) (see also [here](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script%5Fid=415)), so I put them together and made one for EmEditor, the “MinimalZen”.  
 Before EmEditor Pro v7.02 RC1, importing color theme will result in loss of font styles, so I did not release it, but now that bug has been fixed, I put it here: <http://www.box.net/shared/dnj42nqyow>  
 Hope someone will like it, and thanks for the great work of EmEditor’s developer Yutaka, Zenburn’s author [Jani Nurminen](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/), and Minimal’s author [Minimal Design](http://minimaldesign.net/).

Fabulous! Really good theme! Although I prefer “Blackboard” than “Minimal” :-)

Great theme! Does anybody know name of the font used in this example?

I updated this theme, to fit the recently released EmEditor version 9, if someone encountered the same problem of jadde29, you can download the new theme from <http://www.box.net/shared/yffuyr1j6n>.  
 If there are any other problems, please tell me. :-)

Hello ToadLoadin,  
 Your MinimalZen theme is quite popular. Unfortunately, the following colors are missing from v12 or v13:  
CompareChange=  
	CompareChar=  
	CompareAdded=  
	CompareDeleted=  
	CompareBlank=  
	Spell=  
	Unicode=  
	VerticalSel=  
	HexSel=  
	IndentGuides=  
	HorzGrid=  
	Outline=  
	LineNumberLines=  
	RulerLines=  
	VerticalSeparator=  
	HtmlCharRef=  
	Ucn=  
	AutoMarker=  
	Marker1=  
	Marker2=  
	Marker3=  
	Marker4=  
	Marker5=  
	Marker6=  
	Marker7=  
	Marker8=  
	Marker9=  
	Marker10=  
	MatchingTag=  
	 Would you please add these colors?  
 Also, is it possible for me to add the MinimalZen theme to EmEditor as one of the installed themes?  
 Thank you!

The menus/button areas still have the light colour. Is it possible to change those to a darker one too?

Please select “Dark” from the App Theme drop-down list box in the View page of the Customize dialog box.

Thanks, I did, but the only think it changed is the colour of the Find/Filter text areas. The menus and toolbars on top remained light colored.

Yes, I realize this an issue.
