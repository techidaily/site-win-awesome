## Step-by-Step Guide: Syncing Your Spotify Library with MediaMonkey

### Overview

* I want to play the Spotify music in MediaMonkey, but it seems that MediaMonkey does not support the Spotify music. By the way, the Spotify music is downloaded with its source format by my former music downloader. Is there any software or tool to help me to successfully play the downloaded Spotify music in MediaMonkey?

Just like iTunes which helps Mac users to manage music and play music, MediaMonkey helps Windows users to manage and play music. However, recently many Spotify users failed to import the downloaded Spotify music to MediaMonkey, that is because some Spotify downloaders only support to download Spotify to protected OGG Vorbis format, the Spotify source format, but the protected OGG Vorbis format is not one of MediaMonkey supported audio formats. For now, MediaMonkey natively supports to play MP3, AAC, WMA, FLAC, MPC, APE, and WAV format.

To fix the issue, a professional Spotify to MediaMonkey downloader and converter - Allavsoft is introduced.
